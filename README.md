# WebARProject
A project where I managed a team of developers to create a WebAR experience to act as a demo for the client's mobile App.
## Intro

This project focused on creating an engaging Web Augmented Reality (AR) experience for
Old Government House, blending technology with the arts and history domain. Our client,
Sal from Wicked Interactive StoryTelling, operates in the heritage sector, revitalising
historical homes and museums by offering interactive, mixed-reality mobile tours. Our
goal was to create an introductory Web AR experience to complement the client’s already
established AR native application for Old Government House.

From a technical perspective, the project leveraged JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as core
technologies. We utilised Three.js, a JavaScript library, to manage the 3D models, handle
animations, and integrate audio. WebXR enabled the AR experience on compatible devices
through the web browser. For testing and quality assurance, we relied on Node.js. Inputs
from the client, including 3D models, animations, and audio assets, were essential in
shaping the application’s final form.
